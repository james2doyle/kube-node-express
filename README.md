Kube-Node-Express
=================

What is this?
-------------
This is a boilerplate for an express-node app built with the Kube CSS framework.

How is this laid out?
---------------------
It is a basic express app. The html engine is Jade and stylesheets are just regular CSS. There is a LESS version of Kube on the Kube website. Just look for the developer version link under the big ol' download button. I used the template from the Kube site and added some gird examples at the bottom for reference.
